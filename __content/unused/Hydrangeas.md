## A symbol of rain

In Japan, hydrangeas are closely associated with the rainy season, which typically occurs in June and early July. Their vibrant blooms coincide with this period of increased rainfall. The sight of hydrangeas in full bloom is seen as a sign that the rainy season has arrived.

This enduring association between hydrangeas and the rainy season in Japan is further enriched by a charming legend known as the "Emperor and Empress and the Rainy Season." According to this tale...

### Emperor and Empress and the Rainy Season

Long ago, there was a sad and rainy season in Japan, which made the emperor and empress unhappy. They prayed for sunshine and clear skies, and in response to their prayers, the hydrangea blossoms appeared, brightening up the landscape with their vibrant colors, even in the rain.

## Fun facts

### Changing Flower Color

Hydrangea flower color can change based on the pH level of the soil. Acidic soil (with a pH below 6.0) tends to produce blue flowers, while alkaline soil (with a pH above 6.0) results in pink flowers. You can adjust the flower color by amending the soil with additives like aluminum sulfate for bluer blooms or lime for pinker blooms.

Types of Hydrangeas: There are several different species and varieties of hydrangeas, each with its unique characteristics. Some common types include:
Bigleaf Hydrangea (Hydrangea macrophylla): Known for their large, globe-like flower heads and the ability to change color based on soil pH.
Panicle Hydrangea (Hydrangea paniculata): These hydrangeas have cone-shaped flower clusters and are often more sun-tolerant.
Oakleaf Hydrangea (Hydrangea quercifolia): Recognized for their distinctive oak-like leaves and cone-shaped flower clusters.
Smooth Hydrangea (Hydrangea arborescens): Known for its round, white flower heads and hardiness.

Symbolism and Meanings: As mentioned earlier, hydrangeas have various symbolic meanings, often tied to their colors. They can symbolize gratitude, understanding, love, and purity, depending on the context and color.

Cut Flowers: Hydrangeas are a popular choice for cut flower arrangements and wedding bouquets due to their large, showy blooms and the variety of colors they come in.

Dried Hydrangeas: Hydrangea blooms can be dried and used in floral arrangements and crafts. They tend to retain their color well when dried.

Hydrangea Care in Pots: While hydrangeas are often grown in gardens, some varieties can thrive in pots or containers. This allows you to enjoy their beauty on patios or balconies.

Pruning Guidelines: Pruning requirements for hydrangeas vary by type. Some bloom on old wood (last year's growth), while others bloom on new wood (current season's growth). It's essential to know the specific type of hydrangea you have to prune it correctly and avoid cutting off potential flower buds.

Hydrangeas Around the World: Hydrangeas are not limited to one region or country. They are cultivated and appreciated in many parts of the world, including North America, Europe, Asia, and beyond.

Hydrangeas are versatile and beautiful plants that can add a touch of elegance and color to gardens and floral arrangements. Whether for their symbolism, unique flower characteristics, or adaptability, hydrangeas remain a popular choice among gardeners and flower enthusiasts.


## Taking care of the flower

Hydrangeas are popular flowering shrubs known for their beautiful blooms. Proper care is essential to keep hydrangeas healthy and encourage abundant flowering. Here is some general information on how to take care of hydrangeas:

Choosing the Right Location:
Hydrangeas prefer partial to full shade, especially in hot climates. Morning sun with afternoon shade is often ideal.
Ensure well-drained soil that retains moisture but does not become waterlogged.

Planting Hydrangeas:
Plant hydrangeas in the spring or fall when the weather is mild.
Dig a hole that is as deep as the root ball and about two times as wide.
Add organic matter, such as compost, to the soil to improve its quality.
Place the hydrangea in the hole, making sure it's at the same depth as it was in the nursery pot.
Water thoroughly after planting.

Watering:
Hydrangeas like consistently moist soil, but they don't tolerate waterlogged conditions.
Water deeply when the soil begins to dry out, typically about once a week. Adjust the frequency based on weather conditions and soil type.
Avoid overhead watering, as wet leaves can lead to fungal diseases.

Mulching:
Apply a 2-3 inch layer of organic mulch, such as wood chips or bark, around the base of the plant to help retain moisture and regulate soil temperature.

Fertilizing:
Fertilize hydrangeas in early spring with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer.
Avoid excessive nitrogen, as it can lead to lush foliage at the expense of blooms.

Pruning:
The timing and method of pruning depend on the type of hydrangea you have.
For most hydrangeas, prune dead or weak stems in late winter or early spring before new growth begins.
Remove spent flowers to encourage more blooms.
Some hydrangeas, like the mophead and lacecap varieties, can benefit from occasional rejuvenation pruning to remove older, woody stems.

Changing Flower Color (for some varieties):
The flower color of some hydrangea varieties can be altered based on soil pH.
Acidic soil (pH below 6.0) tends to produce blue flowers, while alkaline soil (pH above 6.0) results in pink flowers.
You can adjust soil pH using additives like aluminum sulfate (for blue flowers) or lime (for pink flowers).

Winter Protection (for Cold Climates):
In colder regions, apply a layer of mulch in late fall to insulate the roots and protect them from freezing temperatures.

Pest and Disease Management:
Keep an eye out for common pests like aphids, spider mites, and powdery mildew. Treat as needed with appropriate insecticides or fungicides.

Proper care can help your hydrangeas thrive and produce beautiful blooms year after year. Remember that specific care requirements may vary depending on the hydrangea variety you have, so it's a good idea to check for any specific guidelines for your particular type of hydrangea.
