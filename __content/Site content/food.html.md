_Intensely sweet with a cool, minty finish._

The mint mango is perhaps the sweetest fruit ever discovered. Its appearance is that of a mango, with a thicker, syrup-like juice, and a bright, minty aftertaste. It's no wonder Honey Slimes seek them out or that they have such amazingly fresh breath.

It is the favorite food of the Honey Slime.

### Heart Beet

_If you listen to it closely, you can faintly hear a veggie._

Heart beets get their name from their deep, red color and heart-like shape. Heart beets are also unusually juicy for a beet, making it the only veggie that's not for the squeamish in the kitchen.

## Meat: The Savory Solution

Sometimes, a slime's hunger can only be satiated with a hearty serving of meat. From tender hen hens to the occasional tasty treat found while exploring the Far, Far Range, meat is a high-value food source that can entice certain carnivorous slimes to your ranch. In this section, we'll uncover the savory side of slime cuisine and learn how to keep those meat-loving slimes satisfied.

_Has a rock solid conviction... in chicken stuff._

Stony hens are thought to have evolved from hen hens who once trekked deep into the mountains of the Far, Far Range. Perhaps these birds were seeking a clarity of mind that one can truly obtain through meditation amongst these lofty, barren crags. But most likely, they were just stupid and got lost.
