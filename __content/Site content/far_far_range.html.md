_A distant home for distant hearts._

Beatrix begins her life on a humble ranch in the middle of an area in the Far, Far Range known as the Dry Reef. Once the property of the legendary slime rancher and notorious old codger, Hobson Twillgers, the ranch has seen better days, as Hobson let it come into a state of disrepair shortly before disappearing completely.

_A coral-crusted ocean floor that now basks under a golden sun._

The environment surrounding the ranch is known as the Dry Reef and is an arid, wind-swept land covered in dusty crags and rocky cliffs shaped by the wind over the millennia.

The Dry Reef is primarily home to pink, tabby, and rock slimes though phosphor slimes will also come out from hiding when the sun sets. The Dry Reef's climate doesn't make for abundant of any particular resource, but there are plenty of carrots, pogofruit and hen hens, as well as some less common resources if you know where to look.
