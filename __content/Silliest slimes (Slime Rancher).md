### Slime Rancher

![[header.jpg]]

Slime Rancher is the tale of Beatrix LeBeau, a young plucky rancher who sets out for a life a thousand light years away from Earth on the 'Far, Far Range' where she tries her hand at making a living wrangling slimes. With a can-do attitude, plenty of grit, and her trusty Vacpack, Beatrix attempts to stake a claim, amass a fortune, and avoid the continual peril that looms from the rolling, jiggling avalanche of slimes around every corner.

Here you will be introduced to core mechanics of Slime Rancher from silly residents, to otherworldly produce, to the lovely landscapes.

### Slimes

#### Pink Slime

*Their coral hue is scientifically proven to be the color of cheer.*

![[SlimePinkSR2.webp]]

Pink Slimes are the most common slime found on the Far, Far Range. They're cheerful, docile, and the easiest of all slimes to ranch. A pink slime will eat anything you put in front of it, though they have no favorite food, and their plorts are the least valuable of all slimes.

#### Cotton Slime

*A hop, a skip, a jump and- oh, it's gone.*

Cotton slimes seem to have adapted to life among the tall grasses of Rainbow Island by developing a spring in their step that allows them to leap far higher into the air than any other slime. Once airborne, these floofy-tailed slimes are always hoping their hops land them in a patch of delicious water lettuce.

### Resources

#### Mint Mango

*Intensely sweet with a cool, minty finish.*

The mint mango is perhaps the sweetest fruit ever discovered. Its appearance is that of a mango, with a thicker, syrup-like juice, and a bright, minty aftertaste. It's no wonder Honey Slimes seek them out or that they have such amazingly fresh breath.

#### Water Lettuce

*The only glass of water with your daily dose of fiber!*

![[Water_Lettuce_SP.webp]]

Like a desert bloom or a deep sea pearl, water lettuce is a small miracle. The dry season can be difficult for wildlife on the Far, Far Range. But through the humble water lettuce, nature has found a way to provide. The water stored inside the plant prevents its leaves from wilting under the sun's rays, and in turn the crisp leaves keep the water cool and protected, perfect for a thirsty critter in search of relief from the heat.

### Locations

#### The Conservatory

*Your gateway to a prismatic paradise.*

![[IconZoneConservatory.webp]]

Strangely, imperfections and wear on its various structures seem to be part of the design, as if it was created for a museum exhibit. And yet, there is a palpable feeling throughout that this was a home to someone, that it was built with love and purpose.

#### The Rainbow Fields

*Shifting colors like a dream, fading just as quickly.*

![[IconZoneFields.webp]]

Every day is one perfect, unending lazy afternoon in the Rainbow Fields; the kind that would make anyone want to stretch out across its prismatic grasses and while away the hours watching marshmallow clouds drift slowly across the sky.
