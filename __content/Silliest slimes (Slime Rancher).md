### Slime Rancher

![[header1.jpg]]

Slime Rancher is the tale of Beatrix LeBeau, a young plucky rancher who sets out for a life a thousand light years away from Earth on the 'Far, Far Range' where she tries her hand at making a living wrangling slimes. With a can-do attitude, plenty of grit, and her trusty vacpack, Beatrix attempts to stake a claim, amass a fortune, and avoid the continual peril that looms from the rolling, jiggling avalanche of slimes around every corner.

### Slimes

Slimes are gelatinous, ball-shaped, adorable alien creatures that live on the far away planet called the Far, Far Range. They are a key element within the game since they are responsible for the production of plorts that are used to make money, create gadgets, and unlock areas in the game. 

There are several different species of slimes, each found in certain locations on the Far, Far Range. Though their most common features are the permanent happy expressions they have on their faces when fed and their high pitched voices, each type of slime has a unique trait that is used to identify it. Nearly all pure slimes are capable of stacking. 

#### Pink Slime

*Their coral hue is scientifically proven to be the color of cheer.*

![[SlimePinkSR2.webp]]

Pink Slimes are the most common slime found on the Far, Far Range. They're cheerful, docile, and the easiest of all slimes to ranch. A pink slime will eat anything you put in front of it, though they have no favorite food, and their plorts are the least valuable of all slimes.

#### Tabby Slime 

*Those stripes, that tail, that wiggle, wiggle, wiggle.*

![[SlimeTabbySR2.webp]]

Tabby slimes share many curious similarities to domesticated house cats of Earth. With their perky ears, striped backs, and swaying tails, you'd almost mistake them for a true feline... if they weren't made entirely of gooey slime, of course.

### Honey Slime

*Nothing is sweeter than (a freshly produced plort of) honey.*

![[SlimeHoneySR2.webp]]

Honey slimes are an odd breed of slime composed of a hyper-sweet slime compound. Most slime scientists believe this to be the result of their slime cells replicating the natural sugars found in the fruits and floral nectars of the Far, Far Range. Most ranchers agree their plorts taste great on cereal.

### Puddle Slime 

*Keep one in your boot and you'll always stay cool. But it's weird.*

![[SlimePuddleSR2.webp]]

Puddle slimes are a rare species of slime that live in fresh water pools found on the range. These slimes don't eat fruits, veggies, or meat like most other slimes. Instead, puddle slimes absorb water into their bodies while they sit on the surface of a pool.

### Cotton Slime

*A hop, a skip, a jump and- oh, it's gone.*

![[SlimeCottonSR2.webp]]

Cotton slimes seem to have adapted to life among the tall grasses of Rainbow Island by developing a spring in their step that allows them to leap far higher into the air than any other slime. Once airborne, these floofy-tailed slimes are always hoping their hops land them in a patch of delicious water lettuce.

## `food.html`

When a slime eats food it will produce a plort, and its agitation and hunger will both decrease. Each slime has a particular diet, and most of them will eat food from one of the three standard food categories and will not eat foods outside of its diet. In most cases, a slime's favorite food will be in the same food category as its general diet. A slime's diet can be expanded by converting it to a Largo, and can potentially have two favorite foods instead of one. A slime or largo that eats a favored food will produce double plorts.

### Mint Mango

*Intensely sweet with a cool, minty finish.*

![[Mint_Mango_SR2_SP.webp]]

The mint mango is perhaps the sweetest fruit ever discovered. Its appearance is that of a mango, with a thicker, syrup-like juice, and a bright, minty aftertaste. It's no wonder Honey Slimes seek them out or that they have such amazingly fresh breath.

### Water Lettuce

*The only glass of water with your daily dose of fiber!*

![[Water_Lettuce_SP.webp]]

Like a desert bloom or a deep sea pearl, water lettuce is a small miracle. The dry season can be difficult for wildlife on the Far, Far Range. But through the humble water lettuce, nature has found a way to provide. The water stored inside the plant prevents its leaves from wilting under the sun's rays, and in turn the crisp leaves keep the water cool and protected, perfect for a thirsty critter in search of relief from the heat.

### Stony Hen

*Has a rock solid conviction... in chicken stuff.*

![[Stony_Hen_SR2_SP.webp]]

Stony hens are thought to have evolved from hen hens who once trekked deep into the mountains of the Far, Far Range. Perhaps these birds were seeking a clarity of mind that one can truly obtain through meditation amongst these lofty, barren crags. But most likely, they were just stupid and got lost.

### Far, Far Range

![[FarFarRangePlanetCredits.webp]]

The Far, Far Range is an alien planet located a thousand light-years from the Earth, whose natural conditions make up the homes of different kinds of slimes. Having found a new source of income, mega corporations from the Earth sent their people to live on the Far, Far Range as hosts on specially equipped ranches where they care for slimes and extract plorts. That is because no slime has ever produced a plort outside of its atmosphere. Connection between the Earth and the Far, Far Range is supported by StarMail. Players exchange plorts for money at the Plort Market. From time to time, 7Zee offers services by trading newbucks for upgrades to The Ranch and Vacpack.
