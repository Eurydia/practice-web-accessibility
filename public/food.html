					In Slime Rancher, Mother Nature provides

					friends. From juicy heartbeats to plump

					veggies, where nature's bounty plays a

					The mint mango is perhaps the sweetest
					fruit ever discovered. Its appearance is
					that of a mango, with a thicker,
					syrup-like juice, and a bright, minty
					aftertaste. It's no wonder Honey Slimes
					seek them out or that they have such
					amazingly fresh breath.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is the favorite food of

					Heart beets get their name from their
					deep, red color and heart-like shape.
					Heart beets are also unusually juicy for
					a beet, making it the only veggie that's
					not for the squeamish in the kitchen.

				<h2>Meat</h2>

				<p>
					Sometimes, a slime's hunger can only be
					satiated with a hearty serving of meat.
					From tender hen hens to the occasional
					tasty treat found while exploring the
					Far, Far Range, meat is a high-value
					food source that can entice certain
					carnivorous slimes to your ranch. In
					this section, we'll uncover the savory
					side of slime cuisine and learn how to
					keep those meat-loving slimes satisfied.

				<h3>Stony Hen</h3>

				<p>
					Stony hens are thought to have evolved
					from hen hens who once trekked deep into
					the mountains of the Far, Far Range.
					Perhaps these birds were seeking a
					clarity of mind that one can truly
					obtain through meditation amongst these
					lofty, barren crags. But most likely,
					they were just stupid and got lost.

					meat in this section, there's so much
