						charming basics to the more exotic
						species you'll encounter in your
						travels.
					</p>
					<p>
						Whether you're just starting or
						looking to deepen your slime
						knowledge, this is the place to learn

						At their core, slimes are curious,
						amorphous life forms native to the
						Far, Far Range, the alien world where
						your ranch is located. They come in an
						astonishing variety of shapes, sizes,
						and colors, and each type of slime
						possesses unique traits and behaviors
						that make them fascinating to observe
						and care for.
					</p>
					<p>
						Slimes are known for their insatiable
						appetites and their ability to consume
						almost anything in their path, from
						fruits and veggies to other slimes'
						plorts - a valuable resource in the
						world of ranching. As a slime rancher,
						your task is to capture, raise, and
						protect these critters while
						harnessing the resources they produce.

						Honey slimes are an odd breed of slime
						composed of a hyper-sweet slime
						compound. Most slime scientists
						believe this to be the result of their
						slime cells replicating the natural
						sugars found in the fruits and floral
						nectars of the Far, Far Range. Most
						ranchers agree their plorts taste
						great on cereal.

						Puddle slimes are a rare species of
						slime that live in freshwater pools
						found on the range. These slimes don't
						eat fruits, veggies, or meat like most
						other slimes. Instead, puddle slimes
						absorb water into their bodies while
						they sit on the surface of a pool.

						Puddle slimes need fresh water to
						survive and will quickly evaporate if
						left on any other surface for too
						long. cereal.
