								<summary>Video Summary</summary>
								<p>
									We see the video from the
									perspective of the player. The
									video starts with the player
									standing in a field surrounded
									by slimes. The player looks
									around and then starts running
									along a dirt path. The player
									realizes that they are running
									the wrong way so they turn
									around and start running back.
									On the way, the player
									encounters many slimes.
									Eventually, the player arrives
									at a building that looks like a
									large greenhouse. The player
									enters the front entrance.
									Inside, there even more species
									of slimes. The player exits the
									building through the other end
									of the building and runs down a
									narrow path that lead to an area
									with many fruit trees.
									Underneath each tree is an
									abundance of fruits. The player
									starts to collect the fruits.
									The player gathers so much fruit
									that they can no longer hold any
									more. The player makes their way
									back along the narrow path that
									they originally came from. The
									player arrives at the greenhouse
									again, but instead of heading
									inside, the player walks along
									the side of the building. The
									player arrives at the entrance
									of a cave. Inside the cave, we
									see slimes which are sensitive
									to light. The player enters the
									cave and feed the slimes using
									the fruits that they had
									gathered. We can see that the
									slimes are very irritated and
									hungry, but after being fed,
									they are happy. The video ends
									after the player has fed every
									slime in the cave.
