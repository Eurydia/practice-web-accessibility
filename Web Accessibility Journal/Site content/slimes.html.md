## What Are Slimes, Anyway?

At their core, slimes are curious, amorphous life forms native to the Far, Far Range, the alien world where your ranch is located. They come in an astonishing variety of shapes, sizes, and colors, and each type of slime possesses unique traits and behaviors that make them fascinating to observe and care for.

Slimes are known for their insatiable appetites and their ability to consume almost anything in their path, from fruits and veggies to other slimes' plorts â€“ a valuable resource in the world of ranching. As a slime rancher, your task is to capture, raise, and protect these critters while harnessing the resources they produce.

### Pink Slime

_Their coral hue is scientifically proven to be the color of cheer._

Pink Slimes are the most common slime found on the Far, Far Range. They're cheerful, docile, and the easiest of all slimes to ranch. A pink slime will eat anything you put in front of it, though they have no favorite food, and their plorts are the least valuable of all slimes.

**General information:**

| Characteristics | Details    |
| --------------- | ---------- |
| Diet            | Omnivore   |
| Favorite food   | None       |
| Favorite toy    | Beach ball |
| Behavior        | Docile     |

### Tabby Slime

_Those stripes, that tail, that wiggle, wiggle, wiggle._

Tabby slimes share many curious similarities to domesticated house cats of Earth. With their perky ears, striped backs, and swaying tails, you'd almost mistake them for a true feline... if they weren't made entirely of gooey slime, of course.

**General information:**

| Characteristics | Details     |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| Diet            | Carnivorous |
| Favorite food   | Stony hen   |
| Favorite toy    | Yarn ball   |
| Behavior        | Docile      |

### Honey Slime

_Nothing is sweeter than (a freshly produced plort of) honey._

Honey slimes are an odd breed of slime composed of a hyper-sweet slime compound. Most slime scientists believe this to be the result of their slime cells replicating the natural sugars found in the fruits and floral nectars of the Far, Far Range. Most ranchers agree their plorts taste great on cereal.

**General information:**

| Characteristics | Details    |
| --------------- | ---------- |
| Diet            | Vegetarian |
| Favorite food   | Mint mango |
| Favorite toy    | Buzzy bee  |
| Behavior        | Docile     |

### Puddle Slime

_Keep one in your boot and you'll always stay cool. But it's weird._

Puddle slimes are a rare species of slime that live in fresh water pools found on the range. These slimes don't eat fruits, veggies, or meat like most other slimes. Instead, puddle slimes absorb water into their bodies while they sit on the surface of a pool.

Puddle slimes need fresh water to survive and will quickly evaporate if left on any other surface for too long.

**General information:**

| Characteristics | Details      |
| --------------- | ------------ |
| Diet            | Fresh water  |
| Favorite food   | None         |
| Favorite toy    | Rubber ducky |
| Behavior        | Docile       |
